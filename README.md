Achieved 85% validation accuracy.
Includes a comparison of model performance.

Tech Stack
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib

Results
Best Model: Decision Trees.
Accuracy: 85% on validation data.

Future Improvements
Use deep learning models like LSTMs for time-series analysis.
Integrate real-time weather data for live predictions.
